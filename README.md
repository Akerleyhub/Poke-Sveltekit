# Goal: 
To try out the latest and greatest web frontend framework. Used the Pokemon API to do this so I didn't require a backend.

# Thoughts:
It was pretty interesting, I liked how Sveltekit feels and that the HTML,CSS,JS are all together. I haven't poked at a new framework in awhile so I had forgotten that there's a lot to it. Hoping to do a larger scale project with Svelte in the future.

To start app: 'npm run dev'

# create-svelte
Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
